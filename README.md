# Garcilaso de la Vega: Power, Bodies, and the Poetic Gaze

Garcilaso de la Vega is one of the Spanish language's unavoidable reads. In this project, I attempt to shed a new light on his poetry and test some existing hypotheses using LDA topic modeling. Writers Leah Middlebrook and Ignacio Navarrete frame Garcilaso's poetry as an individual's reaction to the consolidation of the Spanish empire during what we now know as the Golden Age. They contend his reaction manifests in an obsession with subjectivity—individual consciousness, individual gazes—and the body. I am also interested in tracing how Garcilaso treats the topic of nature in his poetry.
